# NationalParkApp
Participated in implementing an eduational mobile app which guides users through the parks via the six strands of science learning paradigm. 

Provided users the tools necessary to notice, understand, and respond to environmental issues. 

Implemented the back end management system with Google Maps API, MySQL, PHP, HTML5, CSS, JS, D3.js and JQuery. 

Back End system includes two major components: 1. Learn As You Go 2. Adventure Tracks. This question input system allows the users can create/review the points and questions that are assigned to the locations/tracks.
